# Leasts-squares-algorithm-and-instrumental-variables-algorithm-to-dynamic-system-identification
Parametric identification of discrete transfer function dynamic system representation using LS algorithm and IV algorithm. First version has been written in pure C language because it was designed for fast microcontrollers (like STM32). Unfortunatelly the project was too complicated in this language so then all the project has been rewritten in C++ language (OOP of course).
